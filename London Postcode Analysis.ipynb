    "I often get asked for recommendations by visiting family and friends as to what area of London they should stay in for an upcoming visit. The conversation always takes a predictable path whereby I ask what they like to do, what they want to see or eat, do they like quiet or noisy and then I make a recommendation. What I think would be super helpful is to categorize London by postcode into different types of neighborhood (e.g. quiet, trendy, lots of restaurants, etc.) and then have this list/map available for my friends, family, or just travelers in general to peruse themselves and they can then make their own informed decision."

    "I will scrape a web page for the London postcode information, much like we did in the project analyzing Toronto, and use this in combination with the Foursquare data to categorize and build a picture of what each postcode is like in terms of venues. If the top venues in a postcode are nightclubs then it is a trendy, noisy area. If top venues are riverside cafes, itâ€™s probably a quieter, family-friendly post code. If top venues are tourist attractions, then it might be good for people who want to sight-see."
